### Adapter Mashup
A sample that demonstrates adapters mashup (passing requests between different adapters paths/procedures).

The demonstration is presented in 3 possible combinations:

1. JavaScript adapter -> JavaScript adapter.
2. Java adapter -> JavaScript adapter.
3. Java adapter -> Java adapter.
